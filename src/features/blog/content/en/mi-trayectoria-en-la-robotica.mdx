## The Moment That Ignited the Spark

It all started in a rather peculiar way, back in 2011, when I was just 11 years old. I stumbled upon some YouTube videos where people were creating "dancing brushes": a system as simple as attaching a motor with an off-center weight to a toilet brush. The vibration made it move erratically, much like the old Nokia phones. I was immediately fascinated and, of course, built my own. I believe that was the exact moment the spark was ignited. From then on, my main hobby became disassembling any electronic device I could get my hands on to understand how it worked inside.

During that time, I also immersed myself in the worlds of Minecraft and GMod. Over time, my gameplay shifted to the technical side: in Minecraft, I created complex Redstone systems, while in GMod, I built functional vehicles and even piston engines. It was the same curiosity, but in a digital environment.

## First Steps and Projects

My first real encounter with microcontrollers was in 2014, programming PICs in a simulator. The following year, I bought my first Arduino, and the world of possibilities expanded. Between 2015 and 2016, I built robotic arms with servos and my own Bluetooth radio-controlled cars.

I remember an anecdote from school: in 8th grade, we were asked to make a model of a house. I added a small solar panel that lit up an LED. Curiously, my teacher gave me a low grade and, for the next assignment, specified that the model "could not be functional." The following year, in my first year of high school, I built a robotic arm controlled by a Python interface for the science fair. Despite its complexity, it went almost unnoticed, and the prize went to an arm made with syringes. These experiences taught me that innovation isn't always understood, but I didn't let that stop me.

## The Leap into Competition

In 2016, I got my first big opportunity when I joined the "Coraz√≥n de Chile" team for the **FIRST Robotics Competition** in Los Angeles. My role in the electronics division was to manage the robot's wiring, a critical task that taught me the importance of robustness in a high-demand environment.

The next year, after moving from Santiago, I founded the robotics club at my new high school in Coelemu. Through sheer perseverance, I convinced the principal, and although the robot broke on its first attempt that year, the experience was invaluable. In 2018, we came back stronger and with our own budget, building an aluminum chassis and diving into the world of brushless motors. The result was a **first-place win in the Mega Sumo category at UTFSM**, which earned us a spot to compete in the **ALL JAPAN ROBOT SUMO TOURNAMENT** in Tokyo.

## The Search for "Why": The Origin of My Career

The experience in Japan was a revelation. I realized that commercial brushless motor controllers (ESCs) were a bottleneck: they lacked starting torque, and their response time was too high. To compete at the highest level, I needed something better.

This frustration turned into a clear goal: **to build my own motor controller**. That goal was the main reason I decided to study Electronics Engineering. I needed the fundamental knowledge of power electronics, MOSFETs, and microcontrollers.

For years, I researched and experimented on my own. I designed prototypes, made PCBs at home with acid, and burned countless components. This long process of trial and error culminated in my thesis project: the design and implementation of an FOC (Field-Oriented Control) motor controller. On March 31, 2025, I defended my work, earned the highest possible grade, and closed a chapter that defined my professional path.

## The Present and What's Next

This entire journey, from that simple dancing brush to developing complex controllers, has forged my passion and my skills. Every competition, every failed project, and every success has taught me to be resilient, to solve problems under pressure, and, above all, to never stop learning.

Today, I continue to apply that same curiosity to freelance projects and the development of new technologies, always seeking the next challenge that will allow me to push my knowledge to the limit.
